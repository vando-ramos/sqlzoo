-- Some examples of simple WHERE statements:

-- 1. The population of 'France'. Strings should be in 'single quotes';

SELECT population FROM bbc
WHERE name = 'France';

-- 2. The names and population densities for the very large countries. 
--   We can use mathematical and string expressions as well as field names and constants.

SELECT name, population/area FROM bbc
WHERE area > 5000000;

-- 3. Where to find some very small, very rich countries. We use AND to ensure that two or more conditions hold true.

SELECT name , region
FROM bbc
WHERE area < 2000
AND gdp > 5000000000;

-- 4. Which of Ceylon, Iran, Persia and Sri Lanka is the name of a country?
--    The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list.

SELECT name FROM bbc
WHERE name IN ('Sri Lanka', 'Ceylon', 'Persia', 'Iran');

-- 5. What are the countries beginning with D? The word LIKE permits pattern matching - % is the wildcard.

SELECT name FROM bbc
WHERE name LIKE 'D%';

-- 6. Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking - note that it is inclusive.

SELECT name, area FROM bbc
WHERE area BETWEEN 207600 AND 244820;
